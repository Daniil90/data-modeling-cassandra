# Project 2: Data Modelling with Apache Cassandra.

## Aim of the Project
The aim is to analyze data on songs and user activity collected on the music streaming app. The data is stored in a directory of CSV files and needs to be extracted and stored in Cassandra database

## ETL Pipeline
The ETL pipeline consists of three steps:
1. Extracting data from original CSV files
2. Merging the data into a single CSV file
3. Transferring the data from the CSV file into the database

## Verify the Results
Please run the Jupyter Notebook Project_1B.ipynb in order to verify the results.
